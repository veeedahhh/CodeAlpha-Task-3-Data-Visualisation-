# CodeAlpha-Task-3-Data-Visualisation-

## Overview
This task demonstrates the use of visualizations to communicate insights clearly. By using the libraries Seaborn and Matplotlib, I was able to transform raw data into meaningful visual representations that makes it easier to understand.

## Objective
1. I was able to convert numerical data into charts and visual patterns.
2. I was able to explore correlations between numeric features.
3. I was able to present data in a visually appealing and informative way to make it easier to understand.

## Tools & Libraries Used
1. **Python 3**
2. **Matplotlib**
3. **Seaborn**
4. **Pandas**
5. **Jupyter Notebook**

## Steps Performed
1. I was able to import and clean the **Titanic dataset**.
2. I was able to create bar charts for gender and class survival counts.
3. I also computed correlations between numeric features.
4. And I also visualized relationships using a **heatmap**.

The `csv` file is included in the repository.
